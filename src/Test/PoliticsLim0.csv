11,"Is anyone going to do a follow up on how the Republicans in Congress used the FBI to damage the Hillary campaign.  

Their claim:  Hillary used a private server and deleted emails. 

Why the double standard when GWBush used a private server and deleted all the emails?  

Why did the U.S. news people not only allow but served as handmaids to the Republican party of this not issue? 

Where is a single demand from any news organization to demand why 2 days after Rrince Priebus had a conference3 call about the strong early vote for Hillary and her high polling numbers, 

Comey sent that letter?  Why has a Republican Congressman said the Republicans in Congress have all the Wiener emails as well?
