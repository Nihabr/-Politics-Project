So, we're supposed to trust Trump, who just paid out $25 million for scamming people.  What strange universe did I wake up in?",2016-11-21 10:06:10,3749
3,Obama had to release his birth certificate to prove he wasn't born in Kenya because of a bunch of conservative nutjobs... and Trump can't even release his tax returns. The double standards are ridiculous. ,2016-11-21 14:50:54,1

Why do many of you not want him to release them? Wouldn't he be doing you a service in the interest of full disclosure? And if you're afraid of an impropriety or conflict of interest being revealed, then aren't you essentially admitting to the possibility of there being such a thing? Why would you want that protected?

People arguing against this have no skin in the game by doing so. Just side with us. He should have respected the American people enough to do the due diligence of showing us the truth long ago.",2016-11-21 10:49:43,302

Conflicts of interest are already blatantly obvious and only Obama can apply the needed pressure for capitulation. The media is too impotent to achieve results alone without Obama's persistent, public avocation and condemnation.

I know outgoing Presidents traditionally reserve from commenting publicly about our new administrations but, in my opinion, former ""Vice""-President Dick Cheney put an end to that tradition and this new administration presents a clear and present danger to the future of this country.  The old rules no longer apply.

Lastly, it seems only right that the man who made his name in the modern political arena by dogging President Obama to release birth records for “the public good” should have the favor returned to him by the target of his own vitriol.  ",2016-11-21 10:17:26,67

> He has also immediately violated a promise to separate his business activity from the presidency, prompting suggestions that he will violate the US constitution, which bans public officials from receiving payments from foreign states, the moment he is inaugurated.

> Dozens of foreign diplomats were last week invited to a corporate sales pitch at Trump’s new hotel in Washington DC.

So I shouldn't be charged tax on that amount. ie: Profits are ""Income Minus Expenses"", and a ""tax write-off"" is essentially a declaration that a certain amount should count as an expense before taxes.

There are various *<x>* which qualify. There is various debate about what should entitle one to a write-off (for example, the edges around personal transportation costs are *very* blurry). But *amounts that you are legally compelled to pay, by the government, whose entire purpose is literally to reduce the amount of profit you have in order to make deceptive practices less-profitable*  should count.

Not every ""tax write-off"" is a loophole and a tax dodge. Some of it is *literally* a matter of ""No, I didn't make that much profit this year, because this other amount was an *expense*.""",2016-11-21 17:44:13,1
